# Lab | Object Oriented Programming


## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn about object oriented programming in the context of data science. While we tend to be functional programming oriented in the world of data, there are important uses for object oriented programming. This lab will go over some of them.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned about creating a class that can perform some basic 2D matrix operations.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
