# Guided Project: Resolving Merge Conflicts with Git

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to create and then resolve a merge conflict in git. Doing so will help you practice and build confidence with git.

<b>You will be working individually for this project</b>, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. 

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

- Create a new git branch 
- Create a conflict with the master branch
- Resolve the conflict
- Document all steps in this process using code snippets and screen shots
- Document your thought process and conclusions

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

- <b>A presentation</b> containing the steps you took to create and resolve the conflict.
- <b>A `.README` file</b> containing your thought process and conclusions.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    **Score**|**Expectations**
    -----|-----
    0|Does not meet expectations
    1|Meets expectations, good job!
    2|Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 6 minutes
* Q & A: 3 minutes
* **Total Time:** 9 minutes

### Attire

* DRESS TO IMPRESS: [Smart casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_casual) would be great

### Outputs

- A presentation uploaded to your git repository as a pdf.
- The presentation and demo will be executed on a class computer (instead of your own)

### Things you might want to talk about

* Short presentation of yourself:
	* Who are you?
	* Have you used git before? How do you feel about using git now?
  * __Note: we are getting you ready for final presentation!__
* One technical challenge you faced:
  * Explain the challenge.
  * Explain how and what you did to overcome it.
  * Show and explain code snippets in your presentation slides.
* Git:
  * Show a graph of your commit history to demonstrate where the conflict occurred and how you resolved it.
* Code Walkthrough:
  * Walk the audience through the code you wrote and altered and what steps you took to resolve the conflict.
