# Lab | String Operations and Functional Programming

## Introduction

In this lab we will work on top of the previous Bag of Words lab. Instead of focusing on list comprehension today we will focus on string operations and functional programming.

## Goals

There are two goals in this lab:

1. Convert your work in the [Bag of Words lab](../lab-bag-of-words/README.md) from procedural programming to functional programming.

1. Enhance your Python function so that it can not only process plain texts but also HTML texts.

### Getting Started

In your Terminal, navigate into the directory `your-code` of this lab. Start Jupyter Notebook and solve the following challenges in order: 

1. `Q1.ipynb`

1. `Q2.ipynb`

1. `Q3.ipynb`

## Deliverables

`Q1.ipynb`, `Q2.ipynb`, and `Q3.ipynb` with your solutions.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
