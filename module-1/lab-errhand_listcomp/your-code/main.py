#14. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks. 


for i in ['a','b','c']:
    print i**2


#15. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks. 
#Then use a finally block to print 'All Done.'
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 

x = 5
y = 0

z = x/y




#16. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks. 
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 

abc=[10,20,20]
print(abc[3])

# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 

f = open('testfile','r')

#Hint: the file could not exist and the data could not be convertable to int

fp = open('myfile.txt')
    line = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())




#20. The following function can only run on a Linux system. 
# The assert in this function will throw an exception if you call it on an operating system other than Linux. 
# Handle this exception using try and except blocks. 
# You will probably need to import sys 

def linux_interaction():
    assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "Function can only run on Linux systems."
    print('Doing something.')


# Bonus Questions:

# You will need to make some research on dictionary comprehension to solve the following questions

#21.  Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it. 
# Hint: we need to continually keep checking until we get an integer.
# Use a while loop with a try,except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.




# 22. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9). 
# Use results as the name of the list 




# 23. Define a customised exception to handle not accepted values.
