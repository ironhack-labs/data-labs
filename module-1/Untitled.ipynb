    "# One use case where list comprehensions come in handy is when data is split across multiple files. For example, suppose we had a data directory that contained several CSV files (among other files), each with the same information (columns) for separate groups or divisions. We could use a list comprehension with an endswith('.csv') condition in it to get a list of just the CSV files in that directory. We could use another list comprehension to have Pandas read each of those files and then the pd.concat method to combine them all into a single data set that we can analyze as follows.\n",

Dicts are a sequence of key value pairs. We store the data behind the scenes in a hash map.
