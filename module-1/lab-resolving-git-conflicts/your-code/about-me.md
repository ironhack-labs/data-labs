This is a short intro of myself:
I am from Venezuela, I graduated on 2016 form FIU with an IT bachelorÂ´s degree. Currently, I have a system application analyst job at HBO Latinamerica on the Applications Support Team.

I decided to join Ironhack to obtain more skills that will allow me to move to a different area on the tech industry.

By the end of the course I would like get a job on the healthcare industry as a Data Analyst. My main goal is to participate in a project that will provide means for the company to take better desicions based on data analysis.
