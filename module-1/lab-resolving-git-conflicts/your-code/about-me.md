I am Melin√© Minassian. I grew up in London and am originally from Armenia.
I used to work for QVC as a senior planner.
I have never worked with technology before and have only done fairly basic data analysis in my job.


I decided to come here because I wanted a career change.
I expect to learn programming and statistics.

I am still thinking about which industry I'd like to join but I'd rather not go into retail.
