And he was effective; Chef <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/software-company-chef-wont-renew-ice-contact/\">announced</a> it would not renew its contracts with ICE when they expire. Vargo’s action raises significant questions about the meaning of open source. Is it open if certain users, or types of uses, are forbidden?</p>\\n<h2>Quantum computing trends</h2>\\n<p>IBM and Google are sparring over quantum computing. This month, <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-big-blue-quantum-center-qubit.html\">IBM</a> will be making a 53-qubit system accessible via the cloud, and in a paper from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20879485/google-quantum-supremacy-qubits-nasa\">Google</a>, the company says it has achieved “quantum supremacy” because its system completed a calculation that can only be solved on a quantum computer. (The Google paper appears to have been posted inadvertently by NASA, and then pulled down.) <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342\">Scott Aaronson</a> has a good explanation of what Google has done, why it’s important, and why it doesn’t mean the sky is falling. Truth is, we’re still 10 years away from useful quantum computing.</p>\\n<h2>AR/VR trends</h2>\\n<p>There was a rumor that Apple was going to unveil <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">Apple glasses</a> with the new iPhones. That announcement didn’t happen, so it’s possible this was just a rumor with no basis in a current or future product. I’m inclined to think that’s the case. But what’s interesting is that Facebook is in the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/17/facebook-enlists-ray-ban-maker-luxottica-to-make-orion-ar-glasses.html\">glasses game</a>, too. So is Amazon (with lots of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614436/amazons-new-products-show-it-wants-alexa-to-always-be-with-you/\">Alexa-themed accessories</a>: rings, glasses, earbuds). And Google has never gotten out of the market (Google Glass survives as an <a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/start/\">enterprise product</a>). So regardless of Apple, keep on watching AR and VR.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/artificial-skin-haptic-feedback/\">Artificial skin with haptic feedback</a> is more futuristic than VR glasses, but it could lead to yet another dimension for VR experiences. (Remember Feelies in <em>Brave New World</em>?) Peeling your artificial skin on and off sounds even less convenient than wearing bulky VR goggles, though.</p>\\n<h2>Other trends</h2>\\n<p>GitHub is becoming even more of a platform. The company is integrating features that are normally associated with integrated development environments (IDEs), adding <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/18/github-acquires-semmle-to-help-developers-spot-code-exploits/\">security tools</a>, and a repository for vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<p>There’s yet another web framework: <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>. It’s more reactive than React, eliminates the virtual DOM, and eliminates boilerplate code. The framework wars will probably continue indefinitely.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(cryptocurrency)\">Libra</a>, Facebook’s digital currency, has been much in the news, though there’s still little clarity on exactly what it is. <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-stormclouds-facebook-libra-currency.html\">Regulatory issues</a> (particularly in the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614321/facebook-libra-france-and-germany-say-they-will-oppose-facebooks-digital-currency/\">EU</a>) are going to be a huge issue. Germany and France have said they will oppose Libra, and I suspect a lot of the EU will follow their lead. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-mastercard-others-reconsider-involvement-in-facebook-s-libra-network-11569967023\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> says Visa and Mastercard are “reconsidering.” PayPal is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/04/paypal-withdraws-from-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency.html\">out</a>.</p>\\n<p>One recent announcement from Apple I considered interesting was that the company is getting into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/10/apple-arcade-launch-netflix-for-games-will-cost-499-a-month\">video game streaming</a>. On Twitter, I’ve seen some complaints from game authors and gaming companies about pricing and compensation. We’ll see if Apple manages to suck all the air out of the market.</p>\\n<p>California’s new employment law (<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-18/gavin-newsom-signs-ab5-employees0independent-contractors-california\">AB5</a>) could be a trendsetter for a lot of states. The responses from <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/ab5-update/\">Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/09/11/uber-and-lyft-launch-anti-labor-misinformation-campaign-in-response-to-historic-california-bill/\">Lyft</a> have been nothing short of incredible. It’s hard to see how drivers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/tech/ab5-uber-lyft/index.html\">perform work that is outside the usual course of business for the companies</a>. I don’t think anyone is prepared to accept the idea that these companies are <em>only</em> in the business of providing ride-sharing apps.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/30/20835137/facebook-zuckerberg-elon-musk-brain-mind-reading-neuroethics\">Neuroethics</a> is likely to become a topic of discussion, in response to all the talk about brain interfaces. Despite Elon Musk’s claims (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot\">and some legitimate progress</a>, including an interface that can enable <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49907356\">people with paralysis</a> to move using a mechanical exoskeleton), I don’t think we’ll ever have general-purpose wired interfaces. And unwired interfaces have huge problems with noise and resolution. But regardless of the hype, brain interfaces will become much more useful in the next few years, and they will bring new ethical challenges.</p>\\n<p>Sentiment analysis for social media has always been tough, but we’re starting to see more projects on <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2019-09-body-language.html\">sentiment analysis for body language</a> and emotion. That might work a lot better; it’s hard for your body language to lie or be ironic.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/gNaIpZ2P9us\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-october-2019/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-october-2019/'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 7 October 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 7 October 2019'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/bR0SRT0cgQ0/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/bR0SRT0cgQ0/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/four-short-links-7-october-2019/#respond', 'published': 'Mon, 07 Oct 2019 04:01:40 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=7, tm_hour=4, tm_min=1, tm_sec=40, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=280, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'email': 'jwebb@oreilly.com'}], 'author': 'jwebb@oreilly.com', 'author_detail': {'email': 'jwebb@oreilly.com'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Four Short Links', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=9908', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Addicted to Screens?

It was all just sloughing off personal responsibility, he figures. So the solution is to reclaim responsibility in myriad small ways. For instance: have your phone on silent so there will be fewer external triggers. Email less and faster. Don’t hang out on Slack. Have only one laptop out during meetings. Introduce social pressure like sitting next to someone who can see your screen. Set “price pacts” with people so you pay them if you get distracted—though be sure to “learn self-compassion before making a price pact.”</em></li><li><a href=\"https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=2957\">The Perceptual and Cognitive Limits of Multivariate Data Visualization</a> &#8212; <em>Almost all data visualizations are multivariate (i.e., they display more than one variable), but there are practical limits to the number of variables that a single graph can display. These limits vary depending on the approach that’s used. Three graphical approaches are currently available for displaying multiple variables: (1) encode each variable using a different visual attribute; (2) encode every variable using the same visual attribute; (3) increase the number of variables using small multiples. In this article, we’ll consider each.</em></li><li><a href=\"http://www.afutureworththinkingabout.com/?p=5442\">Any Sufficiently Advanced Neglect is Indistinguishable from Malice: Assumptions and Bias in Algorithmic Systems</a> &#8212; <em>A harm created through persistent ignorance, through willful ignorance of harm raised, is not necessarily very different from harm intentionally done.</em></li><li><a href=\"https://numinous.productions/ttft/\">How Can We Develop Transformative Tools for Thought?</a> &#8212; <em>We believe now is a good time to work hard on this vision again.

This is a snapshot of an ongoing project, detailing both encouraging progress as well as many challenges and opportunities. In the second part of the essay, we broaden the focus.

This goal means that the system&#8217;s power consumption has to be under a milliwatt, ideally a few tens of microwatts. This power level places severe constraints on processor complexity, speed, and memory size. Equally important, it places constraints on communications; communications typically requires more power than computation, even with technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>\\n<p>If a low-power device needs to communicate with the outside world, it can&#8217;t be &#8220;chatty&#8221;; it needs to turn off the radio, turning it on only to transmit short bursts of data. Turning off the radio inverts our models for machine learning on small devices. On a phone, we typically gather data (say, an audio stream) and send it to a server for processing. That’s just too power-hungry for <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">TinyML</a>; we can’t do machine learning by sending data to big iron in the cloud. Any significant processing (for example, listening for a “wake word” like “OK Google”) needs to be done locally&#8211;on a small, slow processor with limited memory. The model that detects the phrase can be trained elsewhere, but the model itself has to run on the phone.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;ve made a lot of progress at running ML models on small processors. TensorFlow has run on the Raspberry Pi for some time, though Raspberry Pi isn&#8217;t really small; it&#8217;s easy to use a recent Pi as a personal computer (and it can be used for training). TensorFlow Lite can be used to run models on Android and iOS phones; though, like the Raspberry Pi, it&#8217;s hard to consider a modern smartphone a &#8220;small&#8221; processor.</p>\\n<p>TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (a port of TensorFlow Lite) takes &#8220;small&#8221; a big step farther. This version can run on a Cortex M3 processor, occupying only 16KB of RAM for the core (yes, that&#8217;s K, not M), and a total of 22KB for a system capable of detecting keywords in speech. If you want to play with this system, the <a href=\"https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170\">Sparkfun Edge Development Board</a> is available for $15. This board is fairly typical for a microcontroller; if anything, with 384KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash memory, it&#8217;s generous. And it draws 1.6 mA, allowing it to run for about 10 days on a common coin battery. That&#8217;s not yet where we want to be, but it&#8217;s getting close.</p>\\n<p>That we can make machine learning work on a controller this small is surprising. But what applications can we build, aside from listening for a wake word on a phone? And why do we want to build them?</p>\\n<p>TinyML can be used anywhere it’s difficult to supply power. “Difficult” doesn’t just mean that power is unavailable; it might mean that supplying power is inconvenient. Think about a factory floor, with hundreds of machines. And think about using thousands of sensors to monitor those machines for problems (vibration, temperature, etc.) and order maintenance before a machine breaks down. You don’t want to string the factory with wires and cables to supply power to all the monitors; that would be a hazard all its own. Ideally, you would like intelligent sensors that can send wireless notifications only when needed; they might be powered by a battery, or even by generating electricity from vibration. The smart sensor might be as simple as a sticker with an embedded processor and a tiny battery. We’re at the point where we can start building that.</p>\\n<p>Think about medical equipment. Several years ago, a friend of mine built custom equipment for medical research labs. Many of his devices couldn’t tolerate the noise created by a traditional power supply and had to be battery powered. I’m sure the successors to those devices are now incorporating machine learning, and I’m sure that massive battery packs are no more welcome now than they were then.</p>\\n<p>I have talked to researchers who are building devices to count bird populations on uninhabited islands. (Recognizing birds by bird call is an extremely difficult problem.) I’ve seen displays in city halls that show every unoccupied parking space. There are startups working on garbage collection: rather than send a truck around once a week, they collect your garbage only when the can is full. Farmers use sensors to report <a href=\"https://mytrellis.com/\">soil moisture</a>. All of these applications require machine learning and sensors in places where it’s inconvenient or impossible to supply commercial power. Solar power is available, but solar is intermittent, and places you on a limited power budget.</p>\\n<p>What could we do if all the devices in our houses were voice controlled? It’s easy to think smart multicolored light bulbs controlled by an app on your phone are silly (I do), but we’ve all needed to turn on a light when our hands were full. We’ve all needed to turn off the stove when our hands were covered in goo. TinyML, with language models capable of recognizing more than a single word, would be ideal for these applications.</p>\\n<p>Think of all the <a href=\"https://www.edgefx.in/importance-of-embedded-systems-in-automobiles-with-applications/\">processors embedded in any car</a>: processors for controlling the brakes, managing the engine, detecting tire pressure, running diagnostics, and many more. These processors have to operate under a very wide range of temperatures, they have to tolerate vibration, they may even need to tolerate moisture. While these constraints differ from TinyML, they have the same solution: processors have to be slow, reliable, with limited memory, and as small a footprint as possible. A high-end Intel or AMD processor, like you’d find in a laptop, can’t work under those conditions. While the constraints are different, the solution is the same; and as these processors incorporate machine learning, the answer will be (and already is) TinyML.</p>\\n<p>TinyML requires us to address problems that haven’t been solved at any scale. Designers for small, embedded devices have to be aware of the “creep factor”: they have to make it clear what data is being used, how it’s used, and how it’s communicated. One solution might be not to send data at all: to build devices that are never networked, with software that is pre-installed and never updated. A device that’s not on a network can’t become a victim of a hostile attack, nor can it violate the user’s privacy. No device can be more private than one that is never online–though such devices can never be updated with improved, more accurate models. Another challenge will be creating mechanisms for creating and recycling these devices; it’s too easy to imagine millions of tiny devices with batteries leaking mercury or lithium into the environment.</p>\\n<p>There are many, many opportunities for smart sensors with embedded machine learning. Almost all of these opportunities are in places where supplying power is inconvenient at best. Even when power is available, other constraints often require slow, small, low-power processors. Every device isn’t a laptop, and we shouldn’t expect it to be; paradoxically, our fascination with bigger, faster processors with gigabytes and terabytes of RAM may be causing us to miss opportunities right in front of us.</p>\\n<p>What can we do with clouds of small, slow-power, memory-limited microcontrollers? What are the opportunities for TinyML? As broad as our imagination. <em>&#8212; Mike Loukides</em></p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Data points: Recent research and analysis</h2>\\n<p>At Radar, our insights come from many sources: our own reading of the industry tea leaves, our many contacts in the industry, our analysis of usage on the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/\">O’Reilly online learning platform</a>, and data we assemble on technology trends.</p>\\n<p>Every month we share notable, useful, or just plain weird results we find in the data.
