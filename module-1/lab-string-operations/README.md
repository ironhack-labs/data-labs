# Lab | String Operations and Bag of Words

## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to manipulate strings. There are two challenges: 1) to practice how to manipulate strings, and 2) to use string manipulation techniques to create Bag of Words (BoW). BoW is an essential technique in Natural Language Processing.

### Getting Started

In your Terminal, navigate into the directory `your-code` of this lab that contains `challenge-1.ipynb`, `challenge-2.ipynb`, `doc1.txt`, `doc2.txt`, and `doc3.txt`. Start Jupyter Notebook by executing `jupyter notebook`. A webpage should automatically open for you but in case not, go to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Then click the link to each ipynb file to complete the challenges.

## Deliverables

`challenge-1.ipynb` and `challenge-2.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.

## Additional Reading

If you are a research-type person, you will find [this article](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/366/1567/1101.full.pdf) interesting. Scientists used techniques based on BoW to calculate the frequency of words used cross 17 world languages. They found there is a consistent pattern in terms of the frequency of words being used in human languages. Some mad scientists even [want to use this technique to analyze dolphin language](http://grantome.com/grant/NSF/PHY-1530544) because they believe they can build corpora based on the sounds dolphins make, correlate the dolphin language corpora with human language corpora, and potentially understand what dolphins speak. :astonished: :astonished: :astonished:
