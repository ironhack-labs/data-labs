# Lab | Two Sample Hypothesis Testing

## Introduction

In `main.ipynb` we'll learn more about hypothesis testing and expand to 2 sample hypothesis tests. If you want to dig deeper you can take `bonus.ipynb` where you'll learn about ANOVA - statistical tests for 3 or more groups.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` (required)
- `bonus.ipynb` (optional)

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
