## Project Description  
In this project, you will:
1. Select the topic to analyze. The topic shoud be related to your interests - kitesurfing, stock prices, human poverty, wine consumption. Whatever touches your heart. 
2. Collect your data - find it among thousands of Databases available online, collect using API or be a thief and scrape some websites. **Two data sources are required!**.
3. Organize your data. Clean your data within the first 2 days - you won't have any time later on. 
4. Visualize your data. Remember, 1 proper plot worth of 5 tables. 
5. Calculate important statistics, describe your data. Start exploring the hidden knowledge of your data!
6. Prepare a model. Forecast or classify - your choice. Model should be tested and validated. Try to analyze your data from different angles and you will find very interesting insights, believe me!
7. Present your project. Code should be organized and structured. Presentation should include all the steps you have done. 



<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals  
* Learn how to develop an interesting question and find the data to answer it.
* Learn how to obtain data from different sources, including APIs, open source datasets and/or scrape data from the web.
* Build a database from the data you find for the whole team to use.
* Explain more complex arguments with plots. 
* Learn the importance of statistical analysis.
* Prepare your first real data model that describes the reality we live no matter how happy or sad it is. 


<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/VZkmCy2O/data-guru-project).
* You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned.
* Your project must include data from at least 2 different data sources (APIs & web, dataset & APIs, ...)
* You must prepare at least 3 models during analysis and present the results during presentation. The best model should be used for final result calculation.

## Deliverables  
You are required to turn in the following:  
1. Link to your repository with your code and README.
2. Access information to your database in Google Cloud with a description of each table and how they relate.  
3. Links to the data you are using (sources) and your organization (trello).  
4. Slides for your presentation.

## Mentoring
One of the Teaching Team will be your mentor!
Your mentor will:
* Follow your project in general, will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following the tasks, your blockers, etc.
* Help/support you in specific questions.

Your mentor is not meant to:
* Know everything.
* Prepare code for you. If Eldiias noticed cheating, you **will be fined and will not get any help from Teaching Team for 1 day.**
* Be your manager. You have to be the responsible person to do the tasks!

If your mentor doesn't have enough knowledge/experience in the topic you chose to provide sufficient help, you have a right to discuss it with Eldiias to find a solution. If the complain has no basis, team is fined for 1 day - no help from Teaching Team.


<a name="schedule"></a>

## Schedule  
*Friday*
* Look for an interesting topic and make some hypothesis or think about some questions to answer about it. 
* Investigate which data sources are available for that topic.
* Reach some best practices agreements as a team.
* Plan your project and organize. Think some risks you can have.
* Start working on your database. 


*Monday*
* Be ready for the topic and ideas validation with the Lead Teacher and TAs.


*Wednesday*
* Be ready for the database validation. Data should be clean and tidy by this date. 
* Start working on your analysis and plots. Think about the plots you want to create and the structure of your paper. 


*Friday*
* All the visualizations and descriptives should be calculated.
* Most of the variables should be defined already. Think of deriving some indices and additional parameters like 'day of the week' and etc.


*Wednesday*
* At least 1 working model should be built already.
* Start working on presentation


*Thursday*
* Finish your analysis and presentation.


*Friday*
* Presentation!

## Presentation
You will have 20 minutes to present your project. The below are some ideas for slides you could include in your presentation; those marked with an **(M)** are mandatory! 


* **(M)** Title of the project
* **(M)** Your topic. Why did you choose it?
* **(M)** Presentation of the team
* Main challenges & strengths
* **(M)** Team. Did you follow your workflow plan? Did you add something after starting the project? Did you follow your best practices agreements? Did you think about the risk management?
* About your data: useful sources, incomplete data, data that would have been great to have, etc. 
* Data cleaning: how and why you cleaned your data the way you did.
* **(M)** Data Viz. 1 slide per plot!
* Data Viz: Prepare insights for every plot. Plots should have a soul.
* **(M)** Stats and Models: Every analysis has a story. Explain what you wanted to obtain by doing this analysis and what were the results.
* **(M)** Models: one slide per model. Explain what data your model depends on and what are the outcomes. 
* Hypotheses testing and Assumptions for every model.
* **(M)** Main insights: one slide per insight!
* Questions you couldn't answer. 
* Something funny that happened during the project. 
* Things you learned during this project.
* If you could start from scratch, what would you do differently?


<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks  
* First, choose your topic and look for sources available.
* Before you start coding and integrate more data, propose some interesting questions you could answer with the data you have.
