We can compute this by using the `np.where` function. If the amount in one column is greater than the other, enter a value of 1, otherwise enter a value of zero.

    "The binomial distribution allows us to calculate the probability of k successes in n trials for a random variable with two possible outcomes (which we typically label success and failure).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of success is typically denoted by p and the probability of failure is denoted by 1-p.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scipy.stats` submodule contains a `binom` function for computing the probabilites of a random variable with the binomial distribution. You may read more about the binomial distribution [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and about the `binom` function [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html#scipy.stats.binom).\n",
