# [Your Final Project Title]

**[Your Name]**

**[Your Cohort Campus & Time]**

## Overview

Include the following points in your overview:

* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?
	* Make sure the question description is human-friendly because you will have non-tech audience to see your final project presentation.
* What is the hypothesis you would like to test in order to answer your question?
	* Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.
* How will you test your hypothesis?	

Notes:

* You can submit the final project with Jupyter Notebook. If you would like to submit a different file format, make sure to discuss with the instructor.
* Based on the nature of your goal and your intended problem-solving approach, you are encouraged to use as many skills, technologies, and tools as possible that you have learned in this course, which include but are not limited to:
	* Python
	* MySQL
	* Statistical analysis
	* Data visualization
	* Jupyter Notebook
	* Tableau
	* Machine Learning
	* Apache Spark / Network Analysis / Natual Language Processing
* Include screenshots wherever relevant.
* Feel free to add more sections to this worksheet.
* Meet with your instructor/TA on daily basis to obtain feedback and support.

## Data Preparation

### Overview:

* What is your dataset about?
* Where/how did you obtain your dataset?
	* It can be either a public dataset or collected with API/web scraping.
	* Provide a link if possible.
* General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.

### Data Ingestion

* If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* If you obtain the data via API/web scraping, provide the scripts.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

* Your full process of data wrangling and cleaning.
* Document your workflow and thinking process.

### Data Storage

* Dump your data to a MySQL database and/or a `.csv` file.

## Data Analysis

### Overview

Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.

### Data Exploration and Visualization

* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.
* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

### Model Training and Evaluation

* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.
* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
	* More data cleaning.
	* Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
	* Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

## Conclusion

* Summarize your data analysis result.
* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.
* What are the next steps?
