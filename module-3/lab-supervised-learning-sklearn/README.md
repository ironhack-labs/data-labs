# Lab | Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn


## Introduction

In this lab, we will begin to explore the scikit-learn library in the context of supervised learning.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned about the scikit-learn library and about different aspects of linear regression.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
