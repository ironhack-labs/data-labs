    "Problem-solving in machine learning is iterative. You can improve your model prediction with various techniques (there is a sweetspot for the time you spend and the improvement you receive though). Now you've completed only one iteration of ML analysis. There are more iterations you can conduct to make improvements. In order to be able to do that, you will need deeper knowledge in statistics and master more data analysis techniques. In this bootcamp, we don't have time to achieve that advanced goal. But you will make constant efforts after the bootcamp to eventually get there.\n",

    "However, now we do want you to learn one of the advanced techniques which is called *feature scaling*. The idea of feature scaling is to standardize/normalize the range of independent variables or features of the data. This can make the outliers more apparent so that you can remove them. This step needs to happen during Challenge 6 after you split the training and test data because you don't want to split the data again which makes it impossible to compare your results with and without feature scaling. For general concepts about feature scaling, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling). To read deeper, click [here](https://medium.com/greyatom/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e).\n",

A library you can utilize is `sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html)). You'll use the `RobustScaler` to fit and transform your `X_train`, then transform `X_test`. You will use logistic regression to fit and predict your transformed data and obtain the accuracy score in the same way. Compare the accuracy score with your normalized data with the previous accuracy data. Is there an improvement?"
